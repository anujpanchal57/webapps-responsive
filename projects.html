                    <p>I have developed several projects in my spare time, developed
                    primarily in Java, usually incorporating databases. These
                    projects were developed mainly for Windows and Android platforms.

                What is the <strong>MHGen Dex</strong>? It is a progress tracking
                mobile application for Capcom's <strong>Monster Hunter Generations</strong>
                (MHGen for short), built by a completionist, for completionists.
                In particular, it is built for <strong>Android 5.0</strong> (Lollipop), and
                allows users to keep track of progress in their quest to collect
                all of the items strongest weapons and armors--all with the
                speed and convenience of a mobile application.</p>

                <p><figure class="imgWrap float-right">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                The MHGen Dex is capable of keeping track of both armor and
                weapon completion progress. Each tab displays a list of tiles,
                each displaying a compact set of information about the item,
                including it's name, rarity, hunter gender and hunter type.
                <br/><br/>
                As items are completed, the background color of the tile will
                change to indicate this. Items can be <strong>pinned</strong>
                and will appear first in the list for quick and easy access.
                Also, not only can specific items be searched for, but the list
                can also be filtered to only display items for your specific hunter
                setup--gender, hunter type and even specific weapon type!</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                Selecting any item on the list will bring up detailed information
                about it including stats, and crafting components. As these
                components are collected, they can be checked off, and will
                count towards their completion.</p>

                The <strong>Kalibur Engine</strong> is a text-based RPG development
                framework and engine, build in <strong>Java</strong> for use on Windows platforms.
                The engine allows a game to be dynamcially generated given a set
                of XML input files. Entire areas/location, weather systems,
                enemies/encounters, events, dialogue, items, and more can be
                generated from a set of files.</p>

                <p><figure class="imgWrap float-right">
                    <img class="img-md img-shadow" alt="" src="img/hke/hke-main.png"/>
                    <figcaption class="imgDescription">
                        <div>Main screen</div>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                Provided with an XML file, the engine can <strong>dynamically
                generate</strong> an area's map, and populate it with "rooms",
                NPC's and events. Generated weather can effect which events occur,
                which NPC's are present, and can even provide Buffs and Debuffs
                in battle. Generated enemies can be encountered in battle, use generated
                attacks, and drop generated items. These items and gear can be
                equipped, upgraded, or sold to NPC's. And that's just to name a
                few</p>

                <p><figure class="imgWrap float-left">
                    <img class="img-md img-shadow" alt="" src="img/hke/hke-xml.png"/>
                    <figcaption class="imgDescription">
                        <div>Location XML</div>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                The highly customizable Events and Dialogue systems can trigger events
                based on <strong>nearly any condition</strong> in the game, ranging from date/time/location,
                to having a certain number of items, to having cleared a previous event,
                or having defeated an enemy. In fact, it is possible to generate complex
                systems such as gear crafting, or character and faction affinities, and
                their related events.
